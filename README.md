### Abstract

Have you ever asked for a tempting dish you saw on the menu, only to receive a substandard meal at half the acceptable size? Or had to pay a week’s worth of rent just for something you could have cooked at home? It can be infuriating, we know. We are a group of passionate data wizards who are looking to utilise the power of evidence-based decision making to set up a chain of Ramen restaurants, with concepts tailored just for you so that you never have to experience this again.

We believe that there is a huge opportunity to launch a restaurant chain using data-driven methods and decision-making to provide highest likelihood of success. None of our members have been involved in the restaurant chain industry prior to this, but with the huge amount of data available from the Yelp dataset and our analytics skills, we are certain that success can be achieved.

As part of this new launch, we decided to focus on successfully and sustainably launching our first restaurant. We have asked ourselves:
- **What** - what cuisine will the restaurant chain serve?
- **Where** - where will the first three to five restaurants be located?
- **How** - how will we design the most attractive attribute set for customers?
- **When** - when will the official launch and the operating hours of the restaurant be?

To arrive at the answers for these, different analyses on available datasets were made. The main dataset that we have worked on is the Yelp dataset containing 5 million reviews of over 150,000 businesses in 12 metro areas in the US. It also includes data about features of restaurants, as well as business opening hours. Additionally, to develop further insights, we have utilized data from:
the United States Census Bureau
the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority
the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
Google Trends

This report includes part of the analysis we did using the Yelp Dataset to answer 3 of those questions: **What (Cuisine in Part 1), How (Strategy in Part 2, 3 and 4) and When (Part 5).**

**Part 1** goal was to select a cuisine that has space for improvement in terms of rating (underperforming) and that is very popular but undersupplied (in terms of reviews per restaurant and checkins). We use four tables from the Yelp Dataset: Categories, Business, Checkins and Reviews.

For **Part 2, 3 and 4** our goal is to determine the business strategy that would improve the chances of success. We performed three analyses that complemented each other. First (Part 2) performing sentiment analysis over customer reviews, second (Part 3) finding the most significant business attributes that positively correlate to a higher business rating or stars, and finally (Part 3) performing a qualitative analysis through a conjoint analysis over a survey sent to people residing in Las Vegas.

The last analysis **(Part 5)** focuses on finding the optimal opening hours for our restaurant, we contrasted the restaurant's opening times in the Yelp dataset against Google’s “popular times” feature. The goal is to have opening times during busy hours, but also when there is low supply (not many open restaurants at the time) but with still demand to be served.
